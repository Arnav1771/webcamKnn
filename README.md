# webcamKnn

Base project for using the webcam and running the results through mobileNet, and the results of that through a KNN to allow for arbitrary classes to be discovered based off a small example set.

# Future work

This is the base for the class project there/not there, and light/dark sensor.


## Base of this project

This is heavily based off of the teachable machine Google tool, however simplified for easy addition to personal projects.
